# Claude Usage Monitor Widget

**Start your Claude 5-hour window before you sit down to work.**

The 5-hour session window doesn't start on a timer — it starts on your *first*
message. So if you get home at six and work until midnight, you burn one window
and wait. Set the widget to send a tiny message at 3pm and the window is already
running when you arrive: it resets at 8pm, and you get a second full allowance
out of the same evening.

That's the point of it. It also happens to be a floating usage display — current
5-hour session and weekly, always visible, so you're not opening the usage panel
every ten minutes — and it can automatically step Claude Code down to a cheaper
model as a window fills up.

- **Auto-ping** — schedule as many window-start times as you like. Each fires only
  if no window is already running, so nothing is wasted. It gives you no extra
  weekly quota; it moves *when* your windows fall.
- **Auto step-down** — at thresholds you set (say 50% → Opus, 75% → Sonnet,
  90% → Haiku), the default model for new sessions drops a tier.
- **Live usage, at a glance** — the real percentages, floating on top or tucked
  under your windows.
- **Twelve skins** — from a Star Trek LCARS panel to something that looks like
  Apple shipped it.

<sub>Screenshots use mock data, and are all at the widget's real 340px width. The
top row shows the settings panel, the second row the heartbeat monitor (an ECG
trace of your scheduled pings); the rest are the compact default view. The macOS
and Windows 11 skins follow your system appearance, so they'll be light or dark to
match &mdash; these were taken in dark mode. LCARS is shown with its fallback font;
install <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Antonio">Antonio</a> for the
exact TV lettering.</sub>

## Launch it

**From the Desktop (no terminal):** double-click **Claude Usage** (the LCARS icon)
on your Desktop. That's it. If macOS ever blocks it the first time, right-click the
icon → **Open** → **Open**.

**From the terminal:**

```bash
cd ~/Applications/claude-usage-widget
npm install     # first time only — downloads Electron (~150 MB)
npm start
```

A compact card appears. Drag it anywhere by its top bar.

## Windows

The widget is cross-platform Electron, and the code now branches per platform for
the Claude data folder (`%APPDATA%\Claude`), the CLI location, power management
and fonts. **Windows is written but untested** — verify before trusting it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jonmgee/claude-usage-monitor-widget
cd claude-usage-monitor-widget
node check-env.js     # reports what it can find on this machine
npm install
npm start
```

`check-env.js` prints only paths and counts (nothing is sent anywhere). The key
line is whether `plan-usage-history.json` is FOUND — that file is where the real
percentages come from. If it's missing, the widget will run but show NO LIVE DATA,
and the path in `usage.js` needs correcting for your setup.

Windows differences:

- **Keep-awake** uses Electron's `powerSaveBlocker` (works on both platforms now).
  The "SCREEN OFF NOW" mode is macOS-only; on Windows it behaves as SYSTEM ONLY.
- **The Desktop launcher** (`Claude Usage.app`) is macOS-only. On Windows, make a
  shortcut to `npm start`, or package the app with electron-builder.
- **Fonts** fall back to Arial Narrow / Consolas / Rockwell / Segoe Print, so the
  skins keep their character without the Mac typefaces.
- Needs **Node.js** installed — which on a work machine may need admin rights.

### Location note

The project lives in `~/Applications/claude-usage-widget` (NOT the Desktop). macOS
privacy protection (TCC) blocks Finder-launched apps from reading Desktop files,
which made the double-click launcher fail with `EPERM` when the folder was on the
Desktop. `~/Applications` is unprotected, so the launcher works without any
permission prompts.

### The Desktop launcher

`~/Desktop/Claude Usage.app` is a small AppleScript app that runs this project's
Electron binary directly. Its `appDir` points at `~/Applications/claude-usage-widget`.
If you move this folder, update that path: edit the AppleScript, recompile the
script, and swap it into `Claude Usage.app/Contents/Resources/Scripts/main.scpt`.

## The buttons (LCARS function rail, left side)

| Icon | Does |
|------|------|
| ↻ refresh | Re-read the usage data now |
| ∿ pulse | Toggle the heartbeat monitor (ECG readout of pings) |
| 📌 pushpin | Toggle "always float on top" vs "lie below other windows" (dims when un-pinned) |
| ▣ corner | Dock — snap to the bottom-right corner of your screen |
| ⚙ cog | Settings — auto-ping and refresh interval |
| ✕ | Close |

## Auto-ping (window scheduling)

The 5-hour session window starts on your *first* message and resets 5 hours later.
Auto-ping exploits that: at times you choose (⚙ → AUTO-PING), the widget sends a
tiny Haiku message to **start a window early**, so it resets while you're still
working — giving you two full session allowances across an evening instead of one.

- **Multiple ping times**: add as many as you like (+ ADD PING TIME) — e.g. one a
  couple of hours before you get up, another before you get home. Remove with ✕.
- Each fires **only if no window is already active** (otherwise the ping is wasted),
  and each time slot fires at most once per day.
- It gives **no extra weekly quota** — this is window *scheduling*, not a cap bypass.
- Needs the Claude Code CLI at `~/.local/bin/claude` (auto-detected).
- **Login expiry warning**: the CLI's sign-in lapses about every 30 days, and when
  it does every ping fails until you run `claude` and sign in again. The card
  warns in amber from a week out (`Login expires in 5 days`), and says
  `Ping failed - CLI signed out` once it has actually bitten. See `SECURITY.md`
  for exactly what the check reads.
- **PING NOW** in settings fires one immediately.

### Auto step-down (model tiers)

As your session fills up, the widget can automatically switch Claude Code's
default model to something cheaper, so you don't burn the last of a window on the
big model. ⚙ → AUTO STEP-DOWN, then set tiers — e.g.:

- at **50%** → **Opus**
- at **75%** → **Sonnet**
- at **90%** → **Haiku**

Add/remove tiers freely (any thresholds, any of Opus/Sonnet/Haiku). The highest
crossed tier wins. The widget shows its state on the card: `STEP-DOWN AT 50% →
OPUS` when armed, `STEPPED DOWN → SONNET` when tripped.

How it works, honestly:

- It writes the `"model"` key in `~/.claude/settings.json` (read-merge-write —
  nothing else in the file is touched). That changes the default for **new**
  sessions and conversations. A conversation you're already in keeps its model
  until you `/model` or restart it — the on-card indicator is your cue.
- Your original setting is remembered and **auto-restored** when the 5-hour
  window resets (usage falls back below the tiers), when you untick the feature,
  or when the widget quits. RESTORE MODEL NOW in settings forces it back anytime.
- It can lag your threshold by a few minutes (usage data updates every ~5 min).
- It has no effect on the claude.ai desktop/web app — Claude Code only.

### Keep Mac awake (caffeinate)

Pings can't fire while the Mac is asleep. ⚙ → KEEP MAC AWAKE runs Apple's
`caffeinate` while the widget is running:

- **SYSTEM ONLY** — the display can sleep but the system stays awake, so pings
  still fire. The usual choice.
- **SYSTEM ONLY + SCREEN OFF NOW** — same, but also puts the display to sleep the
  moment you save: pick it, hit SAVE, walk away. Any key/trackpad touch wakes the
  screen as normal.
- **SYSTEM + DISPLAY** — screen stays on too.
- Caveat: a MacBook on battery with the **lid closed** will still sleep — leave the
  lid open or keep it on power for early-morning pings.

The **heartbeat monitor** (∿ pulse button) shows an ECG trace of pings over the
last 24 hours — a spike per ping, time axis along the bottom.

## Look & feel — skins

Twelve skins, switchable in ⚙ → SKIN (saved across restarts):

- **LCARS** (default) — Star Trek: TNG computer panel. Orange elbow, colored
  function rail, segmented meters. For the exact TV font install the free
  [Antonio](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Antonio) — picked up automatically.
- **DASHBOARD** — Bugatti-style instrument cluster: chrome-bezel gauges with red
  needles and redline zones, LCD readouts, carbon-fibre panel, round chrome buttons.
- **RETRO TERMINAL** — green phosphor CRT: monospace, scanlines, everything in
  glowing green on black.
- **SCRIBBLE** — hand-drawn wireframe: paper background, wobbly ink borders,
  handwriting font, pencil-hatched bars.
- **ENIGMA** — wartime cipher machine: walnut case, brass plaques, black bakelite
  keys with silver rims, cream rotor-window readouts, amber lampboard bars,
  typewriter lettering, and a serial plate (ENIGMA I · Nr. A16247).
- **NIXIE STEAMPUNK** — copper and brass machinery with the percentages as glowing
  nixie tubes (orange digits, glass envelope, teal base).
- **SYNTHWAVE** — neon magenta/cyan outlines glowing on deep purple; laser-pink ECG.
- **COCKPIT** — 737-style EFIS: grey panel, black screens, cyan labels, amber LED
  readouts, green tapes, registration plate G-JONG.
- **GAME BOY** — four shades of DMG pea-green, chunky double borders, pixel-era
  monospace. DMG-01.
- **REACTOR** — seafoam control-room panel with a working **annunciator grid**:
  REACTOR NORMAL / HIGH USAGE (lights at 75%) / SCRAM 90% (blinks red) / AUTO PING,
  black meter windows with red LED digits, strip-chart recorder ECG, and a red
  mushroom close button.

- **macOS NATIVE** — looks like Apple shipped it: translucent vibrancy panel, SF
  system font, system-blue bars, toolbar-style rail, System Settings-style grouped
  rows with green toggles. **Follows your system light/dark mode automatically.**
- **WINDOWS 11** — Fluent design: Mica-style translucent surface, Segoe UI, Fluent
  cards and toggles, accent-blue progress. Also follows system light/dark.

The heartbeat ECG recolours per skin (green / LCD blue / phosphor / ink / system blue).

UI text is authored in sentence case; the themed skins re-uppercase it in CSS, so
the two native skins read naturally while LCARS et al keep shouting.

## Where the numbers come from

Everything is read **locally, with no network calls**.

**The percentages are the real ones.** The Claude desktop app samples your actual
plan usage every ~5 minutes and caches it at:

```
~/Library/Application Support/Claude/plan-usage-history.json
```

Each sample looks like `{ "t": <ms>, "u": { "fh": 12, "sd": 3 } }` where `fh` is the
five-hour session percentage and `sd` is the seven-day (all models) percentage —
exactly the figures the app's own usage panel shows.

Supporting details come from elsewhere:

- **Session reset countdown** — the current 5-hour window, derived from message
  timestamps in `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl`. Accurate to within a few minutes.
- **Weekly reset** — derived from the history file by finding when `sd` last
  dropped to 0, rolled forward in 7-day steps.
- **Plan tier** (the "Max (5x)" pill) — `~/.claude.json`.
- **Token counts** (the small grey figures) — from the Claude Code logs. Cache
  reads are excluded: they were ~93% of raw token volume and are cheap re-reads of
  context, so including them made the numbers meaningless.

## The one caveat

That usage cache **only updates while the Claude desktop app is running**. If it's
closed, the numbers freeze. The footer tells you which state you're in:

- `LIVE 5 min ago` — fresh
- `STALE 2h 14m ago` (in red) — the desktop app hasn't sampled recently
- `NO LIVE DATA` — the cache file wasn't found at all

There is no Fable bar: the cache only records session and all-models percentages,
so a Fable figure would have to be invented.

## Files

- `main.js` — Electron window + always-on-top / dock logic
- `usage.js` — reads the plan-usage cache and works out the session window
- `preload.js` — safe bridge between window and UI
- `renderer/` — the card UI (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `renderer.js`)
- `renderer/preview.html` — design preview with mock data (not used by the app).
  Accepts `?skin=<name>`, `?mon=1` (heartbeat monitor), `?opt=1` (settings),
  `?pct=`/`?wk=` (usage levels) and `?bare=<px>` (drop the harness chrome and lay
  the card out at the real window width).
- `tools/shots.js` — regenerates the README screenshots into `docs/shots/`
  (`npx electron tools/shots.js`, optionally with skin names to do just a few)

Config (refresh interval, pin state) is saved to Electron's user-data folder as
`config.json`.
